<a name="introduction"><h3 align="center">Introduction</h3></a>
<p><b>NeoQuest II</b> is a turn-based adventure game created around 2004. Your goal is to travel 

around Neopia, beat up baddies, thwack overweight bosses in the face, and save some astronauts 

whose lives are in danger. The game can be compared to EarthBound and Zelda, if you're itching to 

compare it to something.</p>
<p>I know that NQII is a fun, strategy-heavy game that most people would enjoy if they tried it. 

Unfortunately, NQII is also extremely challenging and complex, which turns off many people who 

might like it if they tried. That's where I come in. With this guide, I hope to make it easier for 

you to play this great game. (Either that, or it'll make you angry at me from my bad jokes.) Try 

out NQII; you'll never like it until you try it. Enjoy.</p>

<a name="prizes"><h3 align="center">Prizes</h3></a>
<p>Ah yes, everyone's favorite part of NeoQuest II. The prizes. The table below speaks for itself, 

but know that the item given to you is random. Also know that you can only win the Insane item once 

(if you beat Insane for a second time, you get the NP but no item.) On other difficulties, though, 

you get an item each time you win.</p>

<a name="characters"><h3 align="center">Characters</h3></a><br><br>

<a name="goldanditems"><h3 align="center">Gold and Items</h3></a>
<p>First off, there are 8 main types of items: Healing Potions, Slowing Potions, Haste Potions, 

Damage Potions, Resurrection Potions, Weapons, Armor, and Artifacts. I'll go over each one of those 

in detail for you.</p>
<ul>

<li><b>Healing Potions:</b> Just how they sound. If consumed in battle or in the overworld, they 

heal the user by the amount of HP on the potion's description. Potions can heal 15 to 170 HP based 

on the type of potion. Remember that your HP can never go above its maximum.
<li><b>Slowing Potions:</b> These can be thrown at enemies in battle to slow them down. When 

enemies are slowed, they take more time to move (effectively speeding up your team.) Slowing 

Potions slow enemies by 20% to 80% based on the type of potion. It's worth noting that slowing 

potions wear off after a while, so make sure you chuck them again if they wear off. Very useful in 

boss battles.
<li><b>Haste Potions:</b> These can be consumed by your characters in battle to speed them up, 

allowing them to move more frequently. These haste the user by 20% to 80% based on the type of 

potion. Like slowing potions, these wear off after a while. These are useful in boss battles, but I 

rarely use them outside of the hardest boss battles.
<li><b>Damage Potions:</b> These are consumed by your characters so that they can show their emo 

side. /jk These are actually thrown at bosses to damage them. They deal around 10 to 170 HP worth 

of damage based on the potion, but the amount of damage they deal can vary (a potion that does 100 

HP of damage normally does 50 to 130 points of damage, but it can do as little as 10 or as much as 

150.) Again, useful in boss battles.
<li><b>Resurrection Potions:</b> They're expensive but pretty useful. If one of your characters 

dies, these potions revive them and heal them back to 10%-50% of their  max HP. Generally, it 

doesn't matter how much health they restore since you have Healing Potions.
<li><b>Weapons and Armor:</b> These can be found in shops, and they are also dropped by bosses and, 

on Evil and Insane modes, monsters. When you're in Inventory and Party Info, you can equip and 

unequip these to your characters. Their power/defense and the boost they give to your skills should 

be taken into account before you decide which weapon/armor to equip. Note that only one character 

can wield any given weapon; for example, a sword you find can only be wielded by Rohane.

<li><b>Artifacts:</b> These can't be bought or sold; you find them but can't do anything with them. 

They're there to help you progress through the storyline.</ul>
<p>You find gold much in the same way you find items: monsters and bosses drop gold, and any items 

you find that you don't want can be sold for gold. Naturally, you spend gold as well. Gold is spent 

at vendors (duh).</p>
<p>When you speak to a vendor, you go to a menu where you can either buy or sell items. The items 

that the vendor has up for sale are on top, while your inventory is below. You can buy 1, 5, or 10 

of any potion the merchant has in stock (you can carry a max of 20.) You can buy more than one 

weapon if you like, but there's no point to it. You can sell potions (not recommended; you may need 

them later) or weapons (but you can only sell non-equipped weapons.) On Normal mode, items sell for 

half their purchase price (e.g. a 1000-gold item will only sell for 500 gold.)</p>
<p>Most inns cost gold as well. In order to rest there (thereby regaining all your health and 

reviving fainted team members), you normally need to pay some gold.</p>

<a name="gameinterface"><h3 align="center">Game Interface</h3></a>
<p>Here I'll be showing you a little about the interface you'll encounter when playing NeoQuest 

II. Below is a (pretty bad) diagram of what the screen will look like when you first start 

playing.</p></font>

<pre>

************.Talk To Mother...............
...................You have 0 gold........</pre>
<p><font face="georgia">Told you it was bad. Anyway, the top bar is your team information. (As more 

team members join you, more lines will be added to the team information bar.) On the bar, you see 

the characters' names, level, health, and experience. Health goes down by taking hits, while 

experience goes up by beating enemies.</p>
<p>Moving on, look at the compass rose to the right of the page. It actually appears as a circle 

with arrows coming out in all 8 directions. Click one of those arrows to move your character (the 

map is always centered on Rohane.) Below the compass rose is the travel mode: there are two, Normal 

(duh) and Hunting (where you have a better chance of randomly encountering monsters.) I'd recommend 

going on Hunting all game unless you're backtracking. Below the travel mode is the area 

information, which tells you where you are in the world. Below Commands are two links (normally 

just one): Inventory and Party Info (more on that later) and Talk To Mother. If you select Talk, 

you talk to any character who is adjacent to Rohane. There are certain lines which you can say; try 

them all out when talking to anyone. At the very bottom is the amount of gold you have.</p>
<p>Let's look at the map now. R is Rohane, M is Mother, and P is Pongoras. Mother and Pongoras are 

NPCs (non-player characters), both serving different roles. Mother lets you rest for free, 

regaining all your HP, while Pongoras sells potions to you. There are some trees and walls in 

Trestin, and you can't walk on/through either of them (oddly, you can walk on trees in the 

overworld.) The 's and ,s are grass and floorboards respectively.There is a path leading right into 

town and a path leading left out of town.</p>
<p>When you click on Inventory and Party Info, you see your team members and the items you 

currently possess, along with brief descriptions of each item.</p>

<a name="act1"><h3 align="center">Act 1 Walkthrough</h3></a>
<p>Hi and welcome to my walkthrough for Act 1. I'm playing through NeoQuest II as I write each part 

of the walkthrough, so I'll be using the boss levels and skills that I recommend to you. The levels 

I give will be in the form X/Y/Z, where X is Normal mode, Y is Evil mode, and Z is Insane mode. As 

for skills, I find it easier if I put them on my other petpage. <b>Visit <a  href="~Epanastasi">Epanastasi's webpage</a> to see the skills. I'd recommend that you have this 

guide on one tab, with the skills guide on another tab.</b>(Well, either that or you switch back 

and forth between the pages, but that doesn't make too much sense. 'o_o)</p>

<p>Whenever there's a boss, I'll put up its picture and some information about it. Its HP will be 

in the form A/B/C, where A is the boss's HP on Normal, B on Evil, and C on Insane. Recommended 

levels will be in the form X/Y/Z, where X is level on Normal, Y on Evil, and Z on Insane. So if I 

write 1/2/3, that means you should be level 1 if you're playing Normal, 2 if Evil, and 3 if 

Insane.</p>
<b>Oh yeah, big note: I'll try to provide directions when I can, but I'd highly recommend the use 

of maps. Search for "NeoQuest II Maps" on a search engine.</b></p>
<p>The levels I give are recommended. If you feel prepared, you can take on a boss a level or two 

under recommendation; if monsters are too tough, you can stay back and train an extra level or two. 

Your call. So now on to the walkthrough. *dramatic pause*<br><br>
 

<center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/items/sta_nq2_rohanes_mother.gif" width="80"  height="80"><br><b>Trestin Village</b><br>
<i>Where it all begins.</i><br></center>
<p>When you begin, you'll be placed in Trestin Village. There's no one of note here, except Mom who 

will heal you for free.</p>
<p>Now it's time to leave the village. <b>Avatar Alert! You get the "Weakling" avatar if you are 

killed by a Plains Lupe.</b> If you encounter one, hit "Wait 5s" until it kills you. No worries, 

you don't have any gold so you'll be OK.</p>

<p>Head west until you're in the overworld, and don't go more than two steps away from the village 

until you are level 2/3/4. Keep attacking the Plains Lupes until they die, basically. Chances are 

you'll have to run back to Mom after every one or two battles. Once you reach the given level, you 

can move out to the hills and forest to fight. Don't use any healing potions here; if you need to 

be healed, go back to Mom. Once you're level 3/4/5, head west and then north from Trestin until you 

hit another forest. </p>
<p>Enter the cave, but don't go too far in. Get to level 4/5/6 before moving on. If the enemies are 

too hard, leave the cave. Anyhoo, continue through the cave on Hunting mode (the cave's fairly 

linear; generally, you'll want to travel southeast) but try to get to level 5/6/7 before you hit 

the train tracks. The tracks are home to a much tougher gang of monsters, so be careful. Gain 

another level and then switch to Normal mode. Follow the tracks into a building (you'll see tiles) 

and keep following them until you see an obese Kacheek. Don't go up to him right now; stay a few 

steps away.  and then immediately switch to Normal travel mode. This technique works with all 

bosses; remember that you are healed to full HP whenever you grow a level. Walk up to the lard tub 

and get ready to battle.</p>


<center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/nq2/m/m1008_4f897.gif" width="80"  height="80"><br><b>The Miner Foreman</b><br><i>Fear me and my paunch!</i><br>HP: 

50/62/75<br>Special Attacks: None <br>Prizes: 100 NP, 1 weapon/armor</center>
<p>This overweight Kacheek has twice the HP of his (considerably thinner) minions, but he's not too 

hard. Keep attacking him (healing if you get to the yellow) and you should prevail. Make sure you 

equip your new goodie (unequip the Father's Sword if you get a sword.) You'll see a big blue orb 

(what's with all the big blue stuff down here?) below where the Foreman stood; walk onto that and 

you'll be teleported outside the mine. Head east now (if you hit the coast, walk north or south 

until you hit the land bridge.) Cross that land bridge on Hunting mode, beating up the Gelerts in 

the Northern Marches. Once you're in the Northern Marches, head south until you hit the coast 

again. Move east and you'll see another city. Hooray!</p>


<center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/items/gar_jelly_river.gif" width="80"  height="80"><br><b>White River</b><br>

<i>I know it's not white. -_-</i><br></center>
<p>You start off stuck in the northern part of town, since the bridge is impassable. There's an inn 

here; pay 35 gold and you can heal up. It's a good idea to rest here, since if you die you get sent 

back here and not Trestin. Across the street from the inn is the weapon/potion shop. First off, buy 

what you didn't get from the Foreman. If he gave you a sword, buy the armor; if he gave you armor, 

buy the sword <b>but don't sell the Father's Sword. Never sell it.</b> It's useful in the very last 

battle, and besides you won't get much from its sale anyway. If you have cash left over, buy Blast 

Potions (about 10) and Healing Vials (as many as you can carry.)</p>
<p>Head north from White River and you'll find yourself in another forest. Make sure you're on 

Hunting mode and start beating up the Gelerts and Bearogs in the forest. Farther north in the 

forest you'll see a path leading to a cave. Don't enter the cave until you're level 8/9/10. Once 

you reach that level, don't go far from the mouth of the cave. The monsters in the cave are tough; 

if they're too much, leave the cave. Gain a level before heading through the cave in earnest. Just 

follow the puddles southeast. Try to get to level 10/11/12 while going through the cave. Use those 

Healing Vials if you need them; save the Healing Flasks and Potions for later. If you need to 

restock on Healing Vials, run back to White River and buy some (and get some Blast Potions too if 

necessary.) If you need to heal larger amounts of HP, use the Flasks and not the Potions.</p>
<p>Well, stay near the entrance of the cave until you're level 11/12/13. Enter Zombom's tower, make 

sure you're on Hunting mode, and try to gain a level by the time you reach Zombom. On the first 

level, head SE until you find yourself in a corridor. Continue through until you see an opening to 

your north. Then head NE until you hit a wall. (If you hit a pillar, move over a space.) Go north, 

and in the room to your north are the stairs to level 2. Level 2's considerably easier; move west 

for 3 spaces then head all the way south. The stairs are in sight, so you can continue to Level 3. 

It's easy as well; head north and then east until you find yourself between two rows of statues. Go 

north until you hit the stairs to Zombom's level. As soon as you're ready to face him, heal (if 

need be) and walk south toward this big ol' cheerleader.</p>

<center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/nq2/m/m1015_242a2.gif" width="80"  height="80"><br><b>Zombom</b><br><i>Gimme a Z! Gimme an 0! Gimme an M!</i><br>HP: 

120/150/180<br>Special Attacks: Decimate (31 damage to one character), Zeal (haste himself 18%), 

Aid (heal himself 40HP)<br>Prizes: 200 NP, 150 GP, 1 weapon/armor</center>

<p>Zombom's one of the hardest bosses in the game, sorry. Always keep in mind that he can kill you 

in two shots with his Decimate, so if your HP ever goes below 62 make sure you heal (preferably 

with those Healing Potions that you've started to get.) Generally, Blast Potions will hit harder 

than Rohane's melee attack, so start off by throwing some of those. Once you start running out of 

Blast Potions or Zombom gets low on health, switch to Rohane's sword to finish him off. There's not 

much to say about this battle, since it's 1 on 1; watch your health carefully and heal liberally. 

Zombom can heal, but he rarely does. Eventually, the big red peanut lover will die. Make sure you 

equip what he gives you, of course. Take the teleporter outside of his tower and switch to Normal 

travel mode. Head back through the cave (follow the puddles) and make your way back to White River. 

You'll realize that the bridge has been raised, so you can access the southern part of White River. 

Cross the bridge and talk to the first person on your left. Guess who that is...</p>


<center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/nq2/c/p2n1_4993d.gif" width="80"  height="80"><br><b>Mipsy</b><br>
<i>The next time something bites me, it's going to get set on fire.</i><br></center>
<p> That's right, everyone's favorite wizard! For your convenience, I'll tell you how I think you 

should spend her skill points. <b>For Normal mode, put 6 points in Direct Damage (DD) and 5 points 

in Innate Melee Defense (IMD.)</b> For Evil, put an extra point in DD; for Insane, put two extra 

points in DD. Anyway, unequip Mipsy's wand (she can cast spells without one) and sell it across the 

street. Speaking of which, don't bother buying any new weapons or armor for anyone. Never buy wands 

for Mipsy anyway. I'd recommend buying 5 Awakening Potions (yeah, they're expensive), however if 

you follow this guide you (hopefully) won't lose a character. Don't bother buying any of the 

damage/slowing/hasting potions here.</p>
<p>OK, now it's time to head out with your new party member. Switch to Hunting mode now. Your 

battle strategy will change a bit now. Use Mipsy to deal huge damage to one baddie, and have Rohane 

finish them off. You want to get rid of your enemies one at a time. Anyway, once you leave White 

River (to the south, obviously), go due east until you see a mountain. Move one square east when 

you do, and then head SW through the forest. Continue SW until you see another area containing 

trees, hills, and mountains. If you hit the desert, go NW a little. Once you reach the forest, go 

farther into it until you see... a Super Attack Pea lying on the ground! No wait, it's another 

town...</p>
<p>Lakeside isn't very important so it doesn't get its own section. *sniff* But it does get its own 

paragraph! Yaay! Anyhow, rest at the inn (first building on your right) if you need to. The 

building north of the inn is the tavern, a.k.a. the potion shop. I'd recommend buying some Dawdling 

Potions; if you'd like to have some more firepower (literally) against the next boss, grab some 

Flame Potions (a maximum of 5.) You'll need to save your gold for weapons/armor. Speaking of which, 

the building NW of the tavern is the weapon/armor shop. Don't buy anything for Mipsy, but buy for 

Rohane what Zombom didn't give you. If he gave you a sword, buy armor; if he gave you armor, buy a 

sword. (It goes without saying to equip the weapon/armor that you buy and sell the old 

weapon/armor, I won't mention that from now on.) Now I'll ask you to consult your maps so you can 

find the Hermit. Talk to him and get the key you need to enter the Lost City.</p>

<p>Leave town and exit the forested area. Switch to Normal travel mode, go SE a bit, and enter the 

*dun dun dun* Trackless Wastes. There's a reason why I told you to go on Normal mode: the grass 

patch below the desert is a no-encounter zone, so you can use that area to walk around a regain 

some HP after battles. Once you reach the grass patch, switch to Hunting mode and get to level 

14/15/16 (Note: when I say something like this from now on, that means you should get your entire 

gang to the recommended level.) The monsters here give out decent experience, and the monsters 

inside the city are tougher. If you feel you're ready to move on, you can go into the city earlier. 

Whenever you're ready, go to the Lost City of Phorofor (it's pretty close to the grass patch.)</p>

<i>Not so lost anymore, eh?</i><br></center>
<p>When you enter, you'll see a ghost who asks for the key. Luckily, you know the key. The ghost 

disappears (poor guy) and so do the barriers. Enter the city and get on Hunting mode. Head all the 

way south until you see the guard (he's a ghostly Kau.) You should be close to getting to level 

15/16/17; if you are close to leveling up, switch to Normal mode until I tell you. If not, stay on 

Hunting. Continue east until the path ends, then head north a bit until you see another path 

branching off to the east. Switch to Hunting if you were on Normal, and head east until you see the 

next boss.</p>

<center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/nq2/m/m1025_e4a7b.gif" width="80"  height="80"><br><b>Giant Sand Grundo</b><br><i>Another overweight boss? What do they eat around 

here?!</i><br>HP: 120/150/180<br>Special Attacks: Critical Hits <br>Prizes: 2 

weapons/armor</center>

<p>He's not too tough. Have Rohane toss a slowing potion to start, and have Mipsy smack him (the 

Grundo, not Rohane) in the face with her DD spells. Rohane can either toss damage potions or melee 

attack. The obese Grundo can't heal, so he will die eventually. Know that he hits hard and likes 

targeting Mipsy. If Mipsy gets down to yellow, have her heal for the turn. Once you've killed him, 

jump into the teleporter.</p>
<p>You'll find yourself in a Tower On The Hill (real creative name, eh?) I'd recommend going on 

Hunting mode and gaining a level or two before you leave. The wockies here attack in pairs and can 

be annoying if you're underleveled, but thankfully you aren't so they aren't too bad. Now, 

navigation... I'd recommend you consult some maps to make your way out of the place, as it's a bit 

of a maze.</p>
<p>I'll assume you got out OK. Switch to Normal travel mode for now. Head NE through the hills 

until you hit a forest. Start going SE until you see another town in the distance. Hooray!</p>

<center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/items/plu_blumaroopirate.gif" width="80"  height="80"><br><b>Seaside</b><br>
<i>Ahoy! Avast!	Yar! Aye! Arr! (Did I miss anything?)</i><br></center>
<p>You find yourself in the little town of Seaside. First thing you want to do is go east a bit and 

visit the first building to your north. Talk to the shopkeeper, Uthare, but don't buy anything. 

Leave the building and go east until you find yourself at a 4-way intersection (there are actually 

two; go to the one where the north path doesn't lead to the inn.) Go north until you can't anymore 

and then go east. You'll see Uthyni there; talk to him and tell him you're sorry. He should tell 

you that Uthare will give you a discount. Now head back to Uthare and grab some Burst and Dawdling 

Potions (I'd recommend about 10 of each.) You might want to buy about 5 of the hasting potions as 

well. Know that you will have to face 2 more bosses before replenishing your potion supply, and buy 

accordingly. Leave the building and head a little east until you find the weapon/armor shop. You 

should buy something for Rohane, and if you really want to you can buy some robes for Mipsy. At any 

rate, that's all you need to do here in Seaside. If you plan on dying in the next 10 minutes, rest 

at the inn. Leave town and start moving SW. You'll eventually see Meridell Castle; enter once 

you're level 17/18/19.</p>
<p>No one in the castle will talk to you, so ignore them. Go west until you see pillars, and start 

moving north right before you get to the pillars. When you smack into a wall, move west a bit until 

you see the entrance to a room. Go in and face your next sorta-boss.</p>

<center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/items/toy_nq2_ramtor.gif" width="80"  height="80"><br><b>Ramtor (First Time)</b><br><i>At least this guy isn't obese.</i><br>HP: 

200/250/300<br>Special Attacks: Zeal (18% Haste), Liquefy (50 Direct Damage), Repair (70HP 

Individual Heal), Entice (Mesmerize)<br>Prizes: none</center>

<p>Ramtor rarely uses his special attacks in the castle, which is good. He flees once his HP is 

down to 100, and he doesn't give you anything. Bummer. However, that means that you don't need to 

do the standard boss procedure. On Normal and Evil, just hammer away at him until he flees. On 

Insane, it would be a good idea to throw a slowing potion before you start attacking. Ramtor will 

flee eventually, leaving you with a castle full of people who will actually talk to you now. The 

important thing is that the guard who is, uh, guarding the north part of the main entrance (his 

name is Thyet) will let you rest for free. Huzzah!</p>
<p>Now switch to Hunting mode and start training west of the Castle, going back to heal as 

necessary. Once you've gained a level, heal up, switch to Normal, and head west through the hills 

and plains. If you hit the coast, move south a little. You'll now find yourself in a forest; make 

your way NW through it. You'll soon see a little tower on the coast. Let's enter.</p>
<p>This is Ramtor's Tower. Switch to Hunting mode (we'll be gaining 2 levels in this tower) and 

head north into the would-be foyer. From there, move west and make your way through that corridor. 

You'll see steps there; take them and you'll be in Dungeon Level 1. Head east from the stairwell 

and go north once you get the chance. Follow the passageway until you come to a big room with  two 

paths. Make sure you're level 19/20/21 at least and go north. There'll be some stairs for you to 

take, so take them. You'll find yourself back on the ground floor (in case you didn't notice, 

there's a random force field in the middle of the base level. Why couldn't they just put a wall 

there? o_o) Anyhoo, head south and east from the staircase until you see the force field. Get to 

level 20/21/22 and switch to Normal mode. Move east until you see some stairs. Ascend...</p>
<p>This is one of the most infamous tower levels of all time. The Demonic Grarrls are tough and 

annoying enough as is... but here, they come in pairs (or triplets, if you're really unlucky) and 

enjoy ganging up on Mipsy. Yes, it's possible to beat them, but why bother? They'll do a lot of 

damage to you, and the enemies on the below floor give out almost as much EXP. So yeah, if you run 

into some Grarrls, run away. Anyway, move west from your starting point until you're in between two 

rows of statues. Go all the way south and then head west once you hit a wall. Heal up and prepare 

to face the final boss... (Hooray! We're done already! That was easy.)... of this act. Sorry.</p>

<center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/nq2/m/m1035_3e255.gif" width="80"  height="80"><br><b>Ramtor (Second Time)</b><br><i>Haven't I seen you before somewhere?</i><br>HP:

<p>This is the same guy you laughed at in the Castle... but that sly dog (speaking of which, is he 

a Bruce or an Eyrie) healed himself up all the way. Oh well, nothing you can't handle. To start, 

have Rohane toss Dawdling Potions until one works. After that, he should melee attack (you can use 

damage potions, but you'll need to save some for later) and throw more Dawdling Potions if they 

wear off. Mipsy should be focusing on hammering Ramtor with her damage spells. Remember, of course, 

to heal when necessary. At the level you're at, Ramtor should go down without much of a struggle. 

Nice job! You've just beat the first out of 5 acts. Sit back and watch the cutscene, and then 

proceed to Act 2: Terror Mountain.</p>

<a href="#jump">Back to Jump</a><br><br>

<a name="act2"><h3 align="center">Act 2 Walkthrough</h3></a>
<p>Smell that cold mountain air? How refreshing. And look, there's a little town up ahead. Uh, what 

are the Chias in there saying? Arg, I knew I shoulda bought the Rosetta Stone for this language 

beforehand.</p>
<p>Indeed, the first town tells you nothing right now, so don't even bother going in there. 

However, it's quite nice outside the town, as it's a no-encounter area! Hurrah! Well, anyway, 

switch to Hunting mode and leave the general area of the town. You should start encountering some 

Bearogs and Lupes. Hopefully they aren't too hard, as there are no easier enemies you can fight and 

there is no inn. They hit fairly hard (normally 10-20 damage per hit), so don't be afraid to use 

some of your healing potions (from now on, this is a general term; the real Healing Potions aren't 

too good anymore) or go back into the no-encounter zone to walk around and heal a little. Get to 

level 21/22/23 and switch to Normal mode. Make your way NE along the pass until you see a path 

leading into a cave. Enter the cave, and make sure you heal before facing your next boss: the 

Leximp.</p>

<center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/nq2/m/m2015_bade1.gif" width="80"  height="80"><br><b>The Leximp</b><br><i>Nerd power!</i><br>HP: 150/187/225<br>Special Attacks: 

Stunning Strikes, resists magic and potions, very fast<br>Prizes: the Wordstone, 2 Potions of 

Regeneration, 500 NP, 200 GP, 1 weapon/armor</center>
<p>This guy is a terror (how fitting for this act) if you're underleveled. Even at the level you're 

at he's a challenge. Anyway, this guy resists potions, so don't even bother with slowing/damage 

potions. Seriously, I've never gotten a potion to work against him. Rohane should use a haste 

potion, if you have one, and then just start attacking. Mipsy can't do much, but she should try her 

magic attacks anyway (they still do some damage.) The Leximp dies pretty fast, so keep hitting this 

bespectacled Nimmo while watching your HP.</p>

<p>Make your way back to Chia Oscuro, the town you saw at the beginning. You can understand 

everyone now (wait, I spent the $500 on Rosetta Stone already...) so feel free to talk to everyone 

in this cute little town. The green Chia in the big building in the north of town sells potions and 

weapons/armor. The weapons/armor are the exact same (except for name) as the ones in Seaside. Don't 

even bother with the potions, as there are no bosses between this town and the next potion vendor, 

who has stronger potions. The main purpose of this Chia is to sell your old weapons. Head south and 

you're in downtown. The house on the top left of downtown is a free inn. You know what that means. 

So go ahead and gain a level outside of town. It shouldn't be too hard; the enemies give out great 

EXP.</p>
<p>Once you reach level 22/23/24, you can start venturing farther from town. Southern Pass (that's 

the route you're on) is extremely simple. Once you've gained another level, progress into the cave 

at the end of the pass.</p>
<p>The Caves of Terror are one of my least favorite caves, mostly because the monsters in it are 

really powerful. The skeletons can put the hurt on both your characters, and the Grarrls and Krawks 

hit hard outright. However, you need to level up here. The easiest enemies are the ones at the 

mouth of the cave. Grow to level 24/25/26, then switch to Normal and make your way out of the cave 

(I'd recommend using maps, but if you don't use them it's a pretty linear path.) You'll find 

yourself on Eastern Pass. Continue up the pass, and on your right will be the quaint little 

Mountainside Inn. When you enter, talk to the Eyrie just SE of the entrance.</p>

<center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/nq2/c/p3n1_c587d.gif" width="80"  height="80"><br><b>Talinia</b><br>
<i>Back in my day, monsters were twice as vicious!</i><br></center>
<p>Talinia adds major coolness factor to your squad. Though you could jump over to Epanastasi's 

page for the skills, I'll tell you right now. <b>For Normal, put 11 points in Increased Bow Damage 

(IBD) and 6 points each in Multiple Targets (MP) and Innate Melee Haste (IMH.)</b> For Evil, put 

one point in Ranged Attacks (RA); for Insane, put two points in RA.</p>
<p>Speak to the Tuskaninny in the center of the room if you want a rest. That's not a bad idea, as 

it's a long way back to Chia Oscuro. The dude in the SE corner of the room will sell you some 

potions. Grab  some Chill Potions, and if you're low on slowing potions grab some of those. The 

Drowsiness Potions are pretty much the same as the Dawdling Potions from Seaside. Other than that, 

there's nothing more to see here (although the people on the top floor provide some comic 

relief.)</p>

<p>our battle strategy won't change much; Rohane and Talinia will be about equal in terms of power 

at the moment. Start off by having Talinia soften up the enemy party, and then go all-out with the 

rest of your characters.</p>
<p> Now back to the action. Leave the inn and head north a bit. You'll find yourself on a long 

route across Terror Mountain. Switch to Hunting mode and stay on it; you'll want to gain a level or 

two on this route. I'd recommend hugging the southern wall of the pass  and moving west until you 

can't go any farther. From there, head north a bit and then west. Follow the path and you'll 

eventually see a crabby little spider (or is it a spidery little crab?) in the distance. Heal up, 

make sure you're at least level 25/26/27, and walk on up to him.

<center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/nq2/m/m2050_c2406.gif" width="120"  height="60"><br><b>Kolvars</b><br><i>The demented pom-pom thingy.</i><br>HP: 225/281/337<br>Special

<p>This... thingy is really easy. He spends most of his time speeding himself up and slowing you 

down. Thankfully, he doesn't hit too hard and he's fairly inaccurate. To beat him, toss a slowing 

potion first and then start attacking all-out. If you're well-trained and lucky, he won't even land 

a hit on you (happened to me once.) Beat up Kolvars, and you'll see the town of Happy Valley in the 

distance.</p>


<center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/items/mall_mme4sb1_bkgdgrant.gif" width="80"  height="80"><br><b>Happy Valley</b><br>
<i>They must be REAL happy living in the middle of nowhere, eh?</i><br></center>

<p>If you haven't noticed already, the direction in which you enter a city determines where in the 

city you start off. For Happy Valley, I'd recommend moving one space south of Happy Valley and then 

moving north. You want to visit the second house on your right. To get into that house, though, 

you'll have to walk around to the other side of it. No worries though, you'll find it easily 

enough. Talk to the Aisha named Jualie, whose son has evidently gone missing (never fear, here 

comes... you!) Exit Happy Valley, and now position yourself one square SW of Happy Valley. Move NE 

and you'll see Niacha, the lost boy, a few steps NE of where you enter. Talk to him and he'll run 

off. Now, exit Happy Valley yet again.</p>
<p> Now enter Happy Valley from the north. (Cue tour guide mode) To your left is the inn, nothing 

interesting there. To your right are the shops: Potions, Weapons, and Armor. Grab all the Chill 

Potions you can carry, and maybe 10 Frost Potions. Definitely get some Lethargy Potions for the 

next (and last) boss in Terror Mountain. The weapons and armor are a good step up from the last 

town, so grab some of those if you like. Remember, though, any weapons/armor you got from bosses 

have some useful stat boosts. Don't trade those stat boosts for a few points of attack/defense. 

Well, that's that for this town.</p>
<p>Switch to Hunting mode as you leave, but there's a no-encounter zone around Happy Valley. 

Monsters will start arriving soon enough, don't worry. Anyway, there are a couple different routes 

to get across this area. They're all fairly linear and not too tough. As the path turns north, 

you'll notice a little tent and a no-encounter zone. The bottom left fellow in this encampment will 

let you rest for free. Hurrah! Train up to level 26/27/28 in the area south of the encampment, 

resting if necessary. Once you're at that level, head north from the encampment to the mouth of a 

cave.</p>

<center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/items/bg_icecaves.gif" width="80"  height="80"><br><b>The Lost Caves</b><br>
<i>Wait, who could have lost these caves? They're kinda hard to miss.</i><br></center>
<p>And that brings us to our next section. Train around the mouth of the cave, heading out to the 

encampment to heal if necessary. Train well, as the monsters in the rest of the cave are pretty 

tough. Get to level 28/29/30, or even more if you can stand it. Once you've leveled up, resting if 

necessary. Stay on Hunting mode until I tell you to; believe me, it'll help. Get through Level 1 

(I'd recommend consulting some maps for the rest of these caves, but if you can't I'll give you 

brief directions.) Just head NW through the first cave until you get to a building; the stairs are 

in the SW of the building. Now you'll be on Level 2 of the caves. Head south, then east, then 

north. You'll be in the room with the stairwell. Be at least level 29/30/31 before proceeding. 

Level 3 is a joke (it's not even a cave); just head north until you see the chair and then west to 

get to the stairwell. Level 4 is fairly linear, although maps help of course. Start off going south 

until you see the Snowager; go NW from there. Before you leave, get to level 30/31/32. Switch to 

Normal once you get to the right level, and make your way out. </p>
<p>Now that you're out, you'll be grateful you leveled up all the way in the caves. The arrogant 

Kougras and too-lazy-to-shave Chias are pretty powerful and tough to take down. They give out good 

experience, sure, but why not fight the (significantly easier) dervishes in the caves? The 

dervishes give out almost as much experience as the overweight monsters here do. Anyway, make your 

way through the mountaintop, heal up, and prepare to face Scuzzy.

<center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/nq2/m/m2110_582d7.gif" width="100"  height="100"><br><b>Scuzzy</b><br><i>Yes, his name makes me laugh too.</i><br>HP: 

225/281/337<br>Special Attacks: Indifference (32% Slow), Cyclone (36 Group Damage)<br>Prizes: 1000 

NP, 1000 GP, 3 weapons/armor</center>

<p>Scuzzy isn't too tough. If you can get to him, you can beat him. He does hit pretty hard though, 

so watch your character's health like a hawk. His HP is depleted quickly, as he can't heal, and 

he's fairly slow as well. Toss Slowing Potions until he's slowed, use Mipsy's Group Haste (it only 

gives you a small speed boost, but it doesn't hurt), and attack like crazy. Damage Potions aren't 

necessary, as your characters' melee will be hitting him hard enough. Eventually, the big monkey 

thingy will die. Congrats, you've just beaten Act II. Only 3 more to go. Huzzah! Watch the 

cutscene, and move on to the Lost Desert.</p>

<a href="#jump">Back to Jump</a><br><br>

<a name="act3"><h3 align="center">Act 3 Walkthrough</h3></a>
<p>Hey look, a new act. With sand everywhere. Yay. <b>Big note about the Lost Desert: you WILL need 

maps for the whole chapter. It's too huge and complicated to go without 'em.</b> Equip your new 

weapons and head outside the palace. There's nothing vital inside, but Phebiya (the fellow in the 

NW corner of the palace) gives some storyline. Now on to the tents outside the palace. This serves 

as the "city." Each tent has its own little map to it. (OK, is it just me, or do the tents' walls 

look like bacon? O_o) There are 6 tents, but only 3 are important: the northernmost yellow tent and 

the two southernmost tents (yellow and light blue.) The northern tent houses the inn, which, uh, 

houses you if you so choose. The yellow tent in the SW contains the potions merchant. The potions 

you buy now will come in much use later in the game. Buy as many Scorch Potions as you can. The 

slowing potions here are just as powerful as the ones from Happy Valley; buy some if you like, 

although they aren't necessary. The Potions of Great Haste give a huge speed boost, which may be 

useful.Buy 5-10 of them if you want. The bluish tent in the SE with the sword on it is the weapons 

shop. You know what to do here. I'd recommend buying weapons/armor from here only if the stuff for 

sale has a 5+ damage/defense advantage over what you're currently wielding. (The bow here has 25 

damage; only buy it if Talinia's current bow has 19 or less damage.) Of course, no need to buy a 

wand for Mipsy. All right, let's ditch this popsicle stand.</p>
<p>Let's get training! *aww* Well, you'll need it. The boss coming up is pretty tough. Fortunately 

for us, the area just north of Sakhmet is chock full o' nuts - I mean, monsters who give out good 

EXP. Get to level 32/33/34 out here. Use potions only when one character is hurt; if your party is 

really beat up go and rest at the inn. It's only 350 GP (it should only take you 3-4 battles to 

earn that much gold) to completely heal. The monsters in the upcoming areas are tough, so make sure 

you have some potions stocked.</p>
<p>All right, you're now level 32/33/34 and ready to start bashing some new baddies. Head north 

from the huts until you see the coast ahead of you. Then turn east and continue that way until you 

see a temple. Let's enter...</p>

<center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/items/sta_nq2_temple.gif" width="80"  height="80"><br><b>Temple of the Sky</b><br>
<i>Why is this thing on the ground?</i><br></center>
<p>You'll want to gain a level on this, uh, level of the temple. Swich to Hunting mode and head due 

north from the entrance until you bonk your head into a patch of water. Head west and enter the 

corridor that will come up. Go all the way west in the corridor until you can't go any farther. The 

room to your north will house the stairs to the next level of the temple.</p>
<p>First off, switch to Normal mode. Maps would help you on Level 2. Here are some directions if 

you need them: south of your room is a corridor. Go through it, and turn east when the corridor 

ends. You should find yourself in a hall filled with pillars. Go all the way north, then east, then 

south (you're going through the hall.) The hall ends at a wall (clever eh) in the south. Head east 

into a corridor but not into a room. Go west through the corridor until you see a gap (well, 

several gaps) north of you. Heal up and face... another boss. Oh boy.


<center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/nq2/m/m3025_6e4b4.gif" width="80"  height="80"><br><b>Siliclast</b><br><i>Wait a second, haven't I fought big rock thingies

Slow), Infestation (44 Group Damage)<br>Prizes: the Celestial Talisman, 5 Potions of Potent Health, 

600 NP, 2500 GP, 2 weapons/armor</center>
<p>To tell the truth, this guy is a pretty standard boss. However, he's still a challenge. Good 

thing we overtrained for him, eh? Anyway, start off by tossing slowing potions at him until they 

work (when a potion wears off, chuck another one.) Hasting potions will come in handy here; Rohane 

will be your main damage-dealer so make sure he's always hasted. Siliclast hits pretty hard and 

fast, and Infestation can take a huge bite out of your party. Thankfully, it's a really slow spell 

and Talinia has Ranged Attacks. That will set him back a bit, giving you a welcome reprieve to do 

whatever. Speaking of which, heal your party members if they reach the yellow. Silly (awesome 

nickname, no?) can kill Mipsy in 2 hits once she's down to yellow. Once you've beaten him, equip 

the weapons/armor he gave you (if they're useful)... you've done this over 9000 times so I won't 

repeat that line anymore. Now take the conveniently-placed teleporter north of him back to Sakhmet 

(interestingly, this puts you 2 spaces west of where you were plopped at the beginning of the 

chapter.)</p>
<p>Head out to town and sell your old weapons/armor. Stock up on some of the potions you used up as 

well. Once that's done, head out of the village on Normal mode. Hug the coast to your west until 

you see a palace north of you. Time for (yet another) dungeon crawl. *ooh*</p>

<center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/items/mall_semisandcastle.gif" width="80"  height="80"><br><b>Ruined Temple</b><br>
<i>Dangit, I was looking forward to vandalizing the place.</i><br></center>
<p>All right, let's get to it. Switch to Hunting mode and stay on it until you grow to level 

34/35/36. (Once you do level up, switch to Normal.) The baddies here aren't much tougher than the 

ones you just faced. So have fun bullying these pitiful excuses for monsters.</p>
<p>If you've got maps, go ahead and use them now. Head north from the entrance until you see a room 

entrance just north of you. Don't enter it; go west and then north into a corridor. The stairs are 

west of the end of the corridor. You'll now find yourself on Level 2, which is oddly enough in 

perfect condition. SE of the stairs is the entrance to a corridor; enter it and follow it until 

you're spit out into a huge conference room. (You'll know what I mean when you get there.) Head 

north from the conference room into a room full of pillars. The stairs to the next level are in the 

NE corner of this room.</p>
<p>Level 3 is a bit of a maze. Good thing you have directions (and you didn't even need to ask for 

them. Rejoice, fellow men!) Head all the way south from the stairs until you see <i>another</i> 

conference room south of you. What do these monsters do all day, seriously?! At any rate, head 

north from this room (no, the other north; don't head back the way you came.) You'll see a hallway 

leading west from this room; make your way through it. When you see it ending, jump into the room 

to your west. The stairs to the final level of this dungeon are in this room. Go east from the 

stairs until you see a gap south of you. Continue south. You will find some walls in your way; just 

walk around them. Once you see a mummified Krawk below you, heal up and walk up to him.</p>

<center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/nq2/m/m3040_0f9ec.gif" width="80"  height="80"><br><b>Gebarn II</b><br><i>This guy needs a manicure. And a pedicure. And throw in some 

pants while you're at it.</i><br>HP: 350/437/525<br>Special Attacks: Hibernation (53% Slow), 

Contagion (52 Group Damage), Destroy (77 Direct Damage), Restore (100HP Heal)<br>Prizes: the 

Medallion of Wind (upper part), 3 Potions of Greater Health, 700 NP, 3000 GP, 2 

weapons/armor</center>

<p>This undead Krawk appears tough, but he isn't too bad. He'll begin by slowing you, so toss 

potions until he's slowed. Using haste potions on Mipsy (and other characters too, if you like) 

wouldn't be a bad idea. From there, go all-out attacking him with magic, melee, and potions. 

Remember to reapply slowing potions when necessary and to heal if you characters are hit down to 

yellow (don't be afraid to heal; you won't need healing potions any more.) Keep slugging away and 

he will fall, despite his high HP and healing ability.</p>
<p>Take the teleporter back to the palace (this time, you are plopped one more square west than you 

were last time you got teleported here.) Head out to town if you like to replenish some potions or 

sell weapons/armor. You're going to be in another village in just a bit, so you don't need to stop 

by Sakhmet. You can wave goodbye to the town, if you like. Anyway, continue up the coast until you 

are back at the temple. This time, the mountains to the sides of the temple have gone with the 

wind. Proceed past the temple until you find a cluster of huts. This is Waset Village. The first 

thing you want to do is visit the yellow building in the SE of the village. This is the inn. Head a 

little east from the entrance and you'll see... an amnesiac Techo! Guess who?</p>

<center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/nq2/c/p4n2_0aa11.gif" width="80"  height="80"><br><b>Velm</b><br>
<i>Don't fidget. And get a haircut!</i><br></center>
<p>Velm: don't leave town without him. He's my favorite character, mostly because of his awesome 

after-battle comments ("Eat your vegetables!") In addition, he makes the game loads easier by 

healing each and every character for free. That's right, no more time wasted using healing potions 

or stressing about them. Just click the button and Velm can heal them all! Speaking of which, 

here's how to place Velm's skill points on <b>Normal: 10 in Group Healing (GH), 6 in Group 

Shielding (GS), 2 in Mesmerization (Mes), 6 in Innate Melee Defense (IMD), and 9 in Innate Casting 

Haste (ICH.)</b> For Evil, add a point in ICH; in Insane, put two points in ICH.</p>
<p>Once you leave the inn, enter the blue building in the SW of town. The weapon/armor and potion 

merchants are here. Grab some of the new damage, haste, and slow potions; get 20 each of the damage 

and slow potions. You don't need too many haste potions, as you'll be building up Mipsy's Group 

Haste spell shortly. Now, as for weapons/armor... you've probably gotten a fair amount of 

weapons/armor from the last few bosses. If your characters are holding any weapons/armor without 

bonuses, upgrade; but if their weapons/armor have bonuses, don't upgrade.</p>
<p>Your monster battle strategy will change a little now. Velm should put up shields if you're 

against larger groups or Mesmerize if you're against smaller groups. Mipsy can haste the team and 

deal reliable damage to the monsters. Rohane just goes all-out attacking. Talinia uses Multiple 

Targets when she can and all-out attacks as well. Get used to this strategy; you'll be using it for 

the rest of the game.</p>

<p>Anyway, switch to Hunting mode and head NW, hugging the mountains (when I say this, I mean to 

walk so that you are always one space away from a moutain.) Eventually you'll see a gap in the 

mountains and the entrance to a valley. Hug the mountains to your left (it's actually a good 

strategy) and you'll eventually see... another temple. Make sure you're at least level 35/36/37, 

and enter.</p>

<center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/items/clo_ld_jubjub_hat.gif" width="80"  height="80"><br><b>Palace of Ancient Kings</b><br>
<i>What sorta king would want to live in the middle of nowhere like this?</i><br></center>
<p>First off, switch to Hunting mode when you enter and stay on it. The monsters here give out 

awesome EXP. This palace is fairly easy, at least navigation-wise. If you look at maps, you might 

notice that there are no stairs. Muhahaha. Well, to tell the truth, the stairs are below a bed. 

Here's how to get to this secret passageway: head all the way north until you hit some water (don't 

ask me what that's doing in the middle of the desert.) Then go all the way west until you run into 

a wall. Go all the way north until you hit another wall. Is your face hurting yet? There's a room 

above where you are right now; enter it. The bed you're looking for is in the SW corner of the 

room. The basement here is pretty easy. Make your way NE through the joke maze at the beginning of 

the level, and continue north to start your first boss battle with Velm on your side. You should be 

at least level 35/36/37.</p>

<center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/nq2/m/m3080_10cae.gif" width="80"  height="80"><br><b>The Revenant</b><br><i>Big? Check. Ugly? Check. No fashion sense? Check. Yup, 

this guy is your stereotypical NQII boss.</i><br>Note: He comes with two cronies (possessed 

skeletons), but they die once he dies.<br>HP: 600/750/900<br>Special Attacks: Rampant Acceleration 

(38% Haste) Infestation (44 Group Damage), Spellbind (Mesmerize), Shockwave, Slowing Strike 

(5%)<br>Prizes: 750 NP, 2 weapons/armor</center>

<p>This guy looks intimidating, but he's really pretty easy. His henchmen are nothing special; 

don't even bother with them. Focus on hitting the Revenant. As for the battle, the setup for this 

battle will be your standard setup for the rest of the boss battles. Rohane and Talinia should 

throw slowing potions (at the Revenant, in this case), Mipsy should caste Group Haste, and Velm 

should put up shields. If you like, individual members can use hasting potions. From there, Rohane 

and Talinia attack melee with Mipsy using magic or damage potions. Velm heals (duh) and tosses 

damage potions if he has extra time on his hands (that is, no one needs to be healed.) Remember to 

reapply the slowing potions and recast Haste/Shields if need be. The boss himself is nothing 

special, so keep hitting him and he will die.</p>
<p>After beating him, walk NE and you'll meet Lifira, Waset's missing gir-- I mean young lady. Go 

NW of where the Revenant was and you'll see a teleporter. This takes you outside the palace. Switch 

to Normal mode; the monsters here are probably yawn-inducing for you now. From here, hug the 

mountains to your east and continue along them until you see a gap in the mountains (obviously, 

continue through the gap a little.) Move SE from here until you're back at Waset. Sell your old 

weapons and restock potions in the dark blue tent in the SW of town. The red house in the NE houses 

Lifira, so go there to get a bit of storyline (and computer mumbo jumbo.) You have to talk to 

her.</p>

<center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/items/bd_bag_of_sand.gif" width="80"  height="80"><br><b>Sand, Sand, and More Sand</b><br>
<i>Not a living soul in sight--'course, that's mostly due to the HORDES OF RAVENING UNDEAD all over 

the place.</i><br></center>
<p>The title says it all. I'm serious, it's really easy to get lost here. Good thing you have 

RevRev, the newest NPS (Neopia Positioning System) model. Well, now to progress. To begin, head NW 

from Waset until you run into some mountains (seriously, what are mountains doing in a desert?) 

Stick right next to these guys and move north until all the mountains are south of you. Move due 

west from here until you see the hermit Lifira was talking about. Once you talk to him (tell him 

the secret word), switch to Hunting mode. Follow the hermit's directions to get the second piece of 

the medallion. </p>
<p>Now stay on Hunting mode until you get to level 37/38/39. Once you reach the right level, you 

can either continue on Hunting for more EXP (that might be a little hard) or switch to Normal. Your 

call, it doesn't really matter. Anyway, head due SE from where you got the medallion until you hit 

a odd rock formation. Go east and south from here and you'll find yourself in a path between some 

mountains. Follow this path until you meet Bledynn, the most epic win NPC in all of NQII. Behind 

him is the ruined city of Akhten-Ka.</p>
<p>Aren't you sick of ruined stuff? Don't worry, there isn't much more of that left. Anyway, let's 

try to enjoy this not-really-ruined city while we can. Switch to Hunting mode (you don't have to, 

but the enemies here give out good EXP) and head north from the entrance until you see another wide 

road (it's 3 spaces wide) branching out to the west. Turn onto that road and head left a little 

(see, RevRev is giving you directions like a real GPS!) until you see another wide road going 

north. That road brings you into a large building with palm trees all around. Head west and then 

north from the building entrance to meet your next boss. Heal up and prepare to face Coltzan's 

Ghost.</p>

<center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/nq2/m/m3120_e3008.gif" width="80"  height="80"><br><b>Coltzan's Ghost</b><br><i>I thought Coltzan was a nice guy... I mean, he gives 

out free burnt food!</i><br>HP: 750/937/1125<br>Special Attacks: Rampant Acceleration (38% Haste), 

Renew (150HP Heal)<br>Prizes: 800 NP,  2 weapons/armor</center>

<p>At the level you're at, Coltzan shouldn't be too difficult. He can't do much offensively except 

melee attack you. The battle strategy shouldn't change much; slow him, have Mipsy haste you, and 

have Velm put up shields to start. Proceed to bust this ghost.</p>
<p>Once you beat him, he becomes an NPC. Talk to him to get part of the Medallion of Wind (well, 

technically he tells you to find it, but whatever.) Leave town and head up through the mountain 

pass (feel free to talk to Bledynn again if you like, I did. xD) If you look at the Medallion of 

Wind, you'll see a smiley face with a scar just above its nose. That smiley face is the same odd 

rock formation you ran into earlier. The last piece of the medallion is located three spaces west 

of the nose.</p>
<p>Now we need to get back to Waset. Switch to Normal mode and flee from any battle you get into; 

the monsters here are just a waste of time now. Head west until you hit some mountains. Hug these 

and go north until all the mountains are south of you. Move west a few steps and continue south, 

keeping the mountains just to your east. Eventually, you'll find youself back in Waset. Restock 

potions, sell old stuff, you know what to do. Head south from Waset, but instead of going SE to 

Sakhmet go SW. *gasp what a rebel* You'll see a pyramid eventually (yeah I know, it's not a temple 

thingy! Yay!) This is the final dungeon of the Lost Desert. Let's go...</p>

<center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/items/toy_pyramidblocks.gif" width="80"  height="80"><br><b>Zakharukh's Pyramid</b><br>
<i>Well, at least it's a better name than <u>The Great Pyramid</u> in Giza.</i><br></center>
<p>I'd highly recommend that you use maps here. I mean, it's not horrible, but it's pretty tough 

getting through this level without a map (and it's not that easy with a map anyway.) Make your way 

through level 1, and try to be at least level 39/40/41 by the time you advance. (FYI, I found 

myself a full level above these recommendations by the time I entered the Pyramid. It might happen 

to you too.) Level 2 is a slightly easier maze, but maps help here too. Gain your final Lost Desert 

level: get to level 40/41/42. Once that's done, switch to Normal mode. Head up the stairs to the 

top of the pyramid.</p>

<center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/nq2/m/m3140_8a979.gif" width="80"  height="80"><br><b>Anubits</b><br><i>Wonder if he notices the graffiti on the wall behind him. 

</i><br>HP: 1000/1250/1500<br>Special Attacks: Rampant Acceleration (38% Haste), Petrification (62% 

Slow), Protection of Infinity (IMD and IMR +30), Renew (150HP Heal), powerful melee 

attacks<br>Prizes: 1200 NP,  3 weapons/armor</center>
<p>Anubits has high HP, powerful attacks, and a whole bunch of goodies to throw at you. Good thing 

you have high HP, more powerful attacks, and more goodies to throw at him. Setting up for the 

battle is the same, but try to use only the potions you got from Sakhmet. You will want to save the 

Waset potions (the Blister Potions, Inert Inaction Potions, and Alarming Haste Potions) for later 

in the game. Since you can't replenish the Waset potions, don't use them.</p>
<p> Anyway, slow the masked jackal, speed yourself up, and put up shields. You will need good 

shields for this battle, otherwise Anubits can deal over 100 damage to a character if he's lucky. 

And if you're unlucky, he can hit the same character twice. So yeah, make sure Velm heals the team 

when necessary (feel free to use healing potions as well.) Once you've set up, start attacking. 

Potions don't work too well on him if he has shields up, FYI. Keep hitting him and healing when 

necessary, and you should be able to beat the random jackal from nowhere. And I still wonder what 

the Altar of Destiny is. Once you've beaten him, you'll be about 2/3 through the game. Let's party! 

Oh wait, we have two more chapters left. Tell the pizza guy to wait. And put those sodas back in 

the cooler.</p>

<a href="#jump">Back to Jump</a><br><br>

<a name="act4"><h3 align="center">Act 4 Walkthrough</h3></a>

<p>Actually, get the sodas back out. This place looks depressing. That's right, we're in the 

Haunted Woods, home to trees with funny faces, a guy whose biggest nemesis is a tissue, a Happy Fun 

Non-Haunted House, and a bunch of sadistic Chias. Sounds fun. Stop drinking that soda and get ready 

to play. Head south into the first (and last) town in the Haunted Woods.</p>

<center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/items/toy_plushie_ghostlupe.gif" width="80"  height="80"><br><b>Shadow Gulch</b><br>
<i>Who you gonna call?</i><br></center>
<p>That's right, the whole town is infested with ghosts. Unfortunately, we don't get to bust them 

this time. Ah well. Anyhow, the building in the SW of town is the main tourist attraction: it hosts 

the weapon/armor and potion merchants. As for weapons and armor, you'll probably have gotten enough 

goodies from all the Lost Desert bosses that you won't need to upgrade. Only buy new weapons/armor 

if your old weapons/armor have seriously less power (on the order of 5-8 points.) Don't buy weapons 

for Velm or Mipsy, as they never use them. And as for potions, grab 20 each of the Vile's Apathy 

and Rot potions. Haste potions are nice as well, if you're so inclined. Once that's done, switch to 

Normal mode and make your way down the path. The path is U-shaped, so eventually you'll start 

moving north. Von Roo's Castle is at the end of the path, so enter.</p>
<p>Switch to Hunting mode here; you'll want to be level 41/42/43 for the boss at the end of the 

castle. Head north from the entrance until you bang your head. Go east until you bang it again, 

then north until you bang it again (sense a pattern?), then east, then south, then east. Now walk 

your throbbing head south until you see an opening into a room to your west. The stairs to the next 

level are in the far west of that room.</p>
<p>If you're still at level 40/41/42 (I doubt that) by the time you get to Level 2, stay on 

Hunting. If you've leveled up, you can switch to Normal or stay on Hunting (your call.) As for the 

way through Level 2, it's pretty easy. From the entrance room, go north and west to enter the next 

room. From there, just make your way through the rest of the rooms. The boss is waiting for you at 

the end of the dungeon.</p>

<center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/nq2/m/m4025_e5111.gif" width="80"  height="80"><br><b>Meuka</b><br><i>Any tissue's dream come true. </i><br>HP: 

1000/1250/1500<br>Special Attacks: Rampant Acceleration (38% Haste), Petrification (62% Slow), 

Infestation (44 Group Damage)<br>Prizes: 5 Vitality Potions, 850 NP, 2000 GP, 2 

weapons/armor</center>

<p>Meuka is technically an optional boss, but I don't see why you'd want to skip him. Anyway, he 

doesn't have shields or recovery, so he dies quickly. Damage potions work really well against him 

too. Make sure you slow him, have shields up, and have Velm heal liberally. Meuka enjoys spamming 

Infestation, which can quickly put the hurt on your characters. Good thing it's a slow spell, he's 

slowed, and Talinia has Ranged Attacks. Use the time he spends reloading to punch him in the face 

(maybe you don't want to punch him, ew...) Eventually, he will meet his Kleenexite, so to speak. 

Talk to Count Von Roo and take the teleporter out of the castle.</p>
<p>Now you can either go back to Shadow Gulch to restock potions or just continue on. If you used 

over 10 potions against Meuka, go restock, but otherwise it's not necessary. Time to get a move on. 

Switch to Hunting mode now (we'll need to do a good bit of leveling up before the next boss) and 

head east from the castle. You'll find yourself on a path; follow it until you stumble into a 

swamp. Make your way more or less east (you'll have to dodge some trees and squares filled with, 

what is that,  puke?) until you see a cave entrance. Try to be level 42/43/44 before you enter the 

Cave of Dark Things. *ooh I'm so scared*</p>
<p>FYI, you'll want to be level 44/45/46 before you take on the boss at the end of this cave, so 

stay on Hunting until you get to the right level. Don't worry, the wretched spyders here give out 

amazing EXP, so leveling up shouldn't take too long. As for the cave, it's not too bad. Just follow 

the puddles of slime (I hope that's just slime...) until they end, and then follow the stalagmites 

(remember, stalagmites might just reach the ceiling someday) until you see the Spider Grundo. Time 

for another boss battle...</p>

<center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/nq2/m/m4045_92d47.gif" width="80"  height="80"><br><b>Spider Grundo</b><br><i>I admire his ability to spin a (nearly) perfectly square 

web. </i><br>HP: 1200/1500/1800<br>Special Attacks: Wall of Chaos (22-Damage Damage Shield), Renew 

(150HP Heal), Celestial Hammer (45 Damage, 3-Second Stun), immune to Rohane's Stunning 

Strike<br>Prizes: 900 NP, 2000 GP, 2 weapons/armor</center>
<p>The Spider Grundo is really, really annoying. He heals all the time and simply refuses to die. 

He's also like the Leximp in that he can destroy you if you're underleveled. Good thing we leveled 

up a lot for him. First off, have Rohane and Talinia try to slow him with the Potions of Inert 

Inaction (40% Slow): you don't want to use the Vile's Apathy Potions, since you'll need them later 

and you can't replenish them. The Lost Desert potions aren't too important anymore. Of course, 

reapply potions when needed. Velm should put up shields, and Mipsy should haste (these only last 

for 30-40 seconds, so recast when necessary.)</p>
<p>From there, go all-out attacking him. Rohane should use his melee attack (he takes a lot of 

damage from the Damage Shields, so watch his HP), Mipsy should use magic (duh), Talinia her melee 

(duh), and Velm should toss Blister or Scorch Potions. Generally, Spider Grundo won't attack you 

much. If multiple characters are hurt, have Velm heal, but otherwise stay on the offensive. If you 

can't deal enough damage to this annoying arachnid, you might be forced to pull your hair out. Keep 

hitting him and he will eventually go down. All right! The good news is you've beaten one of the 

most annoying bosses in the game. The bad news is that all the bosses from here on out are going to 

be around this level of difficulty. The other good news is that you've gotten good practice from 

beating this guy. Enough with the news... let's move on.</p>

<p>Head west to exit the cave. You'll find yourself on a path, so follow that south. When the path 

ends, you'll find yourself... WHAT THE.</p>

<center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/items/toy_fir_ornament.gif" width="80"  height="80"><br><b>Balthazar's Grove</b><br>
<i>The happy... it burns!</i><br></center>
<p>This place is freaky, let me tell you. where did all the doom-and-death scariness of the Haunted

creepy again. Sounds fun. Well, anyway, you'll notice Balthazar here and a path leading north from 

him. Travel up the path until you see a house. And not just any house. The Happy Fun Non-Haunted 

House. This place sickens me. :P</p>
<p>Switch to Hunting mode as you enter. We're going to grow to level 46/47/48 in this house before 

facing the next boss. So let's get training.</p>
