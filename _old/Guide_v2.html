	<div class="bodycontent" id="introduction">
		<h2 class="headings" id="headings">introduction</h2>
		<p>Ello there. If you were looking for that elusive Fountain of Youth, I think you made a wrong turn at Albuquerque. If you were 

looking for sunflower seeds, diabolical Chias, and amnesiac Techos, I think you've found your page. Congratulations.
			</p>

		<p>So what is this page about? Surely not diabolical Chias, right? Well, no, not really. This is a NeoQuest II guide. If you take the 

time to read this page, you'll chat with wizards with attitude, eat a big ugly dragon for breakfast, and maybe even get the girl! OK, maybe not that 

last one, but as for the rest, satisfaction guaranteed.</p>
		<p>The burning question is: <span class="linethrough"> why did the chicken cross the road</span> what is NQII? In short, NQII 

is like sunflower seeds: it may not look that attractive, but it's addicting if you try it. Trouble is, both are tough nuts to crack (groan.) You can 

consider this guide the nutcracker. We'll break through the tough outside to get to the tasty beating-up-obese-stuff inside. Mmm.</p>
		<p>So, uh, who am I? Good question. I have many names, including "crazy" and "Knucklehead McSpazatron", but you can just call 

me Rev. My goal here is to make NQII more synonymous with "diabolical Chias" than "boring.</p>
		<p>Will Rev ever become sane? Will this introduction ever end? Will you ever get to beat up diabolical Chias? Read on to find 

out...</p>

		</div>

	<div class="bodycontent" id="beginnersguide">
		<h2 class="headings">beginner's guide</h2>
		<p>You must be the new kid in town. Welcome. Well, you won't be very welcomed in this city if you don't know a thing about 	

		NQII (believe me, I've been there before.) Good thing you're reading this guide. In these next paragraphs, I'll be giving you 		

		a crash course on all things NQII.
			</p>
		<p>First things first: in NQII you control <strong>four Neopets</strong>: Rohane the arrogant Blumaroo, Mipsy the violent Acara, 

 		Talinia the (comparatively boring) Eyrie, and Velm the amnesiac Techo. As you travel through the game, these guys will 		

		join you and help you in your quest to beat up baddies. *triumphant fanfare*
			</p>
		<p>When you start the game, you'll be given a screen that looks a little like this one:<br />

				INSERT PIC HERE

			</p>
		<p>Stuff describing screen


		</p>

		<p>Enough of that. Let's get to the actual game. Basically, you want to <strong>gain experience</strong> from bashing baddies 	

		(thereby making you gain a level) so that you're more prepared to beat up the bosses (which is a fancy term for uglier, more		

		overweight baddies.) After each battle, the experience points that the baddies drop is given to your characters. If a character gains 

		enough experience, they <strong>level up</strong>, gaining more max HP (Hit Points, Health Points, or Happy Pigs; take your 	

	pick) and earning a skill point. For now we'll leave it at that.
			</p> 


		<p>Seems like everyone from those annoying Lupes to diabolical Chias is loaded. In addition to giving EXP, baddies drop gold for 	

			you. How convenient. This <strong>cash can be used to buy stuff</strong> (we'll go over "stuff" later.) and stay at inns. 

			We'll talk about that more in the Playing NeoQuest II Section.
			</p>

		<p>Oh yeah, and monsters also <strong>drop healing potions</strong> (dude, these guys have big pockets.) Repeat after me: 	

	we'll go into more detail later. Good, good.</p>
		<p><span class="quote">Dude, I came here to learn how to actually, you know, play the game. Not learn about the contents of baddies' 		

pockets.</span> OK, OK, relax. I'll tell you that there are <strong>5 acts, or chapters</strong> which you play through. While you're 		doing 

this, you'll want to <strong>gain levels (max level is 60)</strong>, buy stylish new armor/weapons, beat up a bunch of fat 		guys, and - in 

the end - lol at a huge ugly dragon and, maybe, get the girl! (Maybe I lied about that last one. *shifty eyes*)
		</p>

		<p>Congrats, you've just leveled up from noob to novice. A few more sections and you'll be a right pro.</p>
		</div>


	<div class="bodycontent" id="playing">
		<h2 class="headings">playing neoquest ii</h2>
		<p>Nice of you to join us. Grab a cup of coffee/tea/soda/motor oil (for the robotically inclined) as you learn a bit more about NQII. 

			There's a lot here so feel free to skim (not ski<strong>p</strong>, skim.)
			</p>

		
		<p><ul>
			<li><strong>Difficulty Modes:</strong> after you beat Normal mode (that's the default one), you can play Evil mode. 	

			Once you beat Evil you can play Insane. The modes get tougher, but the prizes get way better as you win 		

		harder modes. (As an added treat, monsters can sometimes drop weapons/armor in Evil and Insane.) Here's 			

	what you can expect in each mode:
				<ul><li><strong>Normal:</strong> Nothing much to say here.</li>
				<li><strong>Evil:</strong> Monsters have 50% more HP than on Normal, bosses have 25% more HP, stuff 	

				costs 30% more, and enemies drop less gold. It's not as hard as it sounds.</li>
				<li><strong>Insane:</strong> Monsters have double the HP than on Normal, bosses have 50% more HP, stuff 	

				costs 60% more, and enemies drop even less gold. Also, if all your characters die you have to start all 		

			over again. Muhahaha.</li></ul><br />

			<li><strong>The Overworld:</strong> yeah I know it has a funny name, but this is the screen you'll be seeing a lot 	

			when you're playing. The Overworld shows Rohane in an ego-centric position (he's always in the - surprise 		

		surprise - center of your screen.) The overworld can be seen up there ^. From the overworld, you can 				

<strong>walk (and chew gum), talk to peeps, look at your inventory,</strong> or... that's about it, actually. 				

Speaking of which, here's a pic of your inventory screen.<br />
				PIC HERE<br />
				Click on a character to see their skills (more on that later.) If you look at the blue table thingy, you'll see all 	

			the potions/weapons/random junk that's sitting in your backpack. From here, <strong>you can use potions, 		

		equip weapons,</strong> and scrutinize random junk. If that so pleases you.</li>

			<li><strong>Walking:</strong> who knew that walking could be so hard? To tell the truth, it isn't. Just <strong>click 	

			the arrows in the compass rose</strong> which corresponds in the way you want to go. If you want to go west, 		

		hit left. Brilliant eh? Also, there are two modes of travel: Normal (wonder what that could be...) and Hunting 			

	(where you have a better chance of being attacked by baddies.)</li>
			<li><strong>Towns:</strong> baddies need a place to terrorize, and towns are the best things for doing so. Well, from 	

			your point of view towns are a welcome place to buy/sell stuff. Most towns have an <strong>inn (where you 		

		can pay to heal yourself up all the way), potion merchant, and weapon/armor merchant.</strong> When you 			

	talk to a merchant, you can either buy from his inventory (the table on top) or sell from yours (the table on 				

bottom.) And remember: townspeople keep their cities small (one square small) to hid themselves. Funny thing 				is, 

the minute you step on a town you're teleported inside a bustling metropolis with a full 10 people living 				there (if you're 

lucky.)</li>
			<li><strong>Potions:</strong> in the original NQ, there were only Healing Potions. Not to be outdone, NQII has five.
				<ul>

					<li><strong>Healing Potions:</strong> just as they sound. They can be used in or out of 

battle.</li>
					<li><strong>Damage Potions:</strong> no, these don't let you show your emo side. Instead, you 

toss these at enemies (normally bosses) to get some damage against them.</li>
					<li><strong>Haste Potions:</strong> these potions speed up the guy who used them. Not too 

commonly used.</li>
					<li><strong>Slow Potions:</strong>  toss one at a boss and watch him move in slow-mo. Just 

remember that the slow wears off after a while, so re-throw potions if needed.</li>

					<li><strong>Revival Potions:</strong> if someone has fainted/passed out/died, use one of these 

guys on him/her and make them ready to beat up baddies again.</li></ul>
			<li><strong>Monsters:</strong> <span class="quote">Remember, Johnny, monsters don't exist.</span> Johnny's been lied to. Baddies are 

everywhere in NQII, just begging to get squished/mauled/whatever. In fact, they approach you. When you encounter one (or two, three, or four) you'll 

be taken to a battle screen. Here's one for you.<br />
				PIC HERE<br />
				When fighting monsters, click on their picture so they turn into a living target. Then attack (Rohane and Talinia 

can just hit the red button, but Mipsy needs to choose a spell in blue) until it dies. <strong>If there is more than 1 enemy, kill one at a 

time.</strong> Check your guys' health (and time till next action) at the bottom of the screen, and heal if necessary (if your health bar is yellow.) 

Have everyone else ignore him and carry on their business. Rohane should use a healing potion on himself when it's his turn. Once that's done, keep 

punching. If you've noticed, there's a Next Turn value under everyone's picture. In the weird world of NQII, time flows straight (whoa!) but only moves 

if you click a button. If Rohane's next turn is in 2 seconds and a diabolical Chia's in in 3, Rohane will get his turn before the Chia does. 


<strong>Whoever has the smallest time till Next Turn moves next.</strong> Once the monster has been beaten, <strong>you gain EXP, Gold, and 

maybe even some potions.</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Bosses:</strong> hate your boss? Take your anger out on these overweight dudes with no fashion sense. 

<strong>Bosses are conveniently placed at the end of some dungeons and at the end of each act.</strong> Whenever you face a boss, your first 

instinct should be to throw slowing potions until one works. After that, haste your party or set up shields (if possible) and then start attacking with 

melee, spells, or damage potions. Watch your health and re-apply potions as needed. Once the boss dies, <strong>you get EXP, NP, gold, and 

usually weapons/armor. Always equip the dropped weapons/armor.</strong> Make sure you sell the old weapons/armor when you're back in 

town.</li>
			<li><strong>Leveling Up:</strong> when you gain enough EXP to fill up the yellow bar thingy, you level up. As you 

might expect, your level goes up by one and your EXP bar is reset. As you might not expect, <strong>you are completely healed</strong> and your 

max HP goes up a bit. You also gain a skill point to spend wherever you like.</li>

			<li><strong>Skills:</strong> since you level up 59 times during the game, you gain 59 skill points. Each of your guys 

has 7 skills, and you can spend a max of 15 points in each skill. As the skill level goes up, the usefulness of the skill goes up too. See the skills guide 

a little below you to see where to spend these funky skill point thingies.</li>
			<li><strong>Dungeons:</strong> call em what you like: caves, buildings, temples. They're all the same: make your way 

up or down until you meet a boss. Beat the boss and then take the (probable) teleporter behind his carcass to exit the dungeon.</li>
			<li><strong>Maps:</strong> if you plan to follow the Walkthrough, I highly recommend maps. Just use your search 

engine of choice and <strong>search for NeoQuest II Maps</strong>.  Bookmark that site and keep it open as you go through the game.</li>

		</ul></p>

	</div>

	<div class="bodycontent" id="skillsguide">
		<h2 class="headings">skills guide</h2>
			<p>Wanna get to the walkthrough right now? If so you can skip this section... although you should read it later. Eager 	

			beaver. At any rate, I'll tell you the skill name, description, and my thoughts for each skill. If you notice, I sometimes 

tell you to <span class="quote">put points somewhere at the end.</span> Don't be scared, this is because you should stop spending skill points around level 53. Once 

you get your final weapons (I'll let you know when), you can distribute those points. You'll see why when you get to that point.
				</p>

			<p><ul>
				<li><h3 class="biggerheadings">rohane</h3>Rohane is your standard sword-and-shielf warrior, sans shield. 

He can take plenty of hits with his high HP, and he can deal lots of damage as well. He's kinda cool, actually.<br /><br />
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Critical Hits (CH):</strong> (The official name is Critical Attacks, but no one 

uses that.) Anyhow, you know how Rohane normally punches people in the face? With this skill, he can sometimes hit their stomachs to inflict 

(normally 20% to 50%) more pain and suffering. Keyword: sometimes.<br />
							<em>~Great skill to have, especially later in the game when Rohane can deal 

150+ damage on a CH. Rohane's CHs are something to be scared of (if you're a baddie of course.)</em></li>

						<li><strong>Damage Increase (DI):</strong> Don't be fooled. This skill actually reduces 

Rohane's risk of spontaneously combusting. Some say that it increases his average damage output. Lolz.<br />
							<em>~More damage = more fun. This skill is really useful when Rohane is by 

himself or with just Mipsy, since Rohane will be carrying a lot of weight. Definitely get this.</em></li>

						<li><strong>Combat Focus (CF):</strong> Instead of being a haughty Ima-beat-you-up 

dude, Rohane decides to become a haughty Ima-not-listen-to-you fellow. He does less damage, but also takes less.<br />
							<em>~Cool skill (and really annoying when baddies use it), but Rohane's meant 

to be an offensive force. Besides, he can already take plenty of hits. Not that useful.</em></li>

						<li><strong>Stunning Strikes (SS):</strong> I may beat up on Rohane sometimes (read: a 

lot), but he's still pretty cool. With this, he can sometimes shock the other guy with his coolness and set back their turn a few seconds.<br />
							<em>~I like this skill, since if opponents can't hit you they can't hurt you. It 

tends to be resisted on harder difficulties and later bosses, but it's still worth spending a few points in.</em></li>

						<li><strong>Battle Taunt (BT):</strong> You know how you feel like punching someone 

when they make Yo Mama jokes? With this skill, Rohane makes a ton of them, encouraging baddies to focus their attacks on him.<br />
							<em>~Fun skill, but you don't need to invest heavily to get the most effect out of 

it. A few points are always useful, and if you have extra skill points at the end of the game you can put them here. Oh yeah, and yo mama climbed 

over a glass wall to see what was on the other side.</em></li>

						<li><strong>Innate Magic Resistance (IMR):</strong> When baddies use magic on Rohane, 

he just turns his head and takes less damage or resists the attack completely. Hence the name Magic Resistance.<br />
							<em>~This skill definitely helps with boss battles, but it's not absolutely 

necessary until Act 4, where everyone and their mother uses magic. If you have spare skill points at the end of the game, put some here.</em></li>

						<li><strong>Innate Melee Haste (IMH):</strong> When you invest here, Rohane invests in 

4-Hour-Energy to make himself go faster. After he attacks, he has less reload time before he can attack again.<br />
							<em>~Rohane hits really hard, and with this skill he can hit fast as well. Hitting 

hard AND fast? I like it. Put plenty of points here.</em></li></ul>

<li><h3 class="biggerheadings">mipsy</h3>Mipsy is a wizard with attitude. She lol'z at stuff with her mighty spells, but she takes hits about as 

well as a wet paper towel. But still, a wizard with attitude? That's pretty sweet.<br /><br />
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Direct Damage (DD):</strong> The DD vs. GDD debate is right up there with 

the butter vs. jelly debate. DD deals up to 100 damage to a single opponent and is pretty fast.<br />
							<em>~I (and most others) prefer this one over its cousin GDD. Most people kill 

baddies one by one because it's faster and safer that way (you have less things attacking you.) Early on, DD lets Mipsy kill stuff in 2-3 hits, and later 

it's a nice consistent chunk of damage.</em></li>

						<li><strong>Group Direct Damage (GDD):</strong> DD's little cousin. GDD deals up to 64 

damage to each opponent but is a good bit slower.<br />

							<em>~Some people like this skill, but it's so slow that you might as well use DD 

(which is roughly twice as fast.) Not to mention it's not as good against bosses. But hey, it's neat skill.</em></li>

						<li><strong>Group Haste (GH):</strong> Mipsy conjures 4-Hour-Energy and gives some to 

everyone on your team. Amazingly, everyone moves a bit faster.<br />
							<em>~Mipsy can't do much outside of mauling stuff... but this skill is extremely 

useful against bosses. If you slow them and speed yourself, you'll be doubly fast and have a much easier time. Put plenty of points here, but only 

after other skills have been built up.</em></li>

						<li><strong>Slowing (Slow):</strong> This spell lets Mipsy, inexplicably, slow down the 

opponent without having to use slow potions.<br />

							<em>~Ironically, the fact that it does the same thing as slow potions does it in. 

Why spend all those points here when you could just toss potions? And besides, Mipsy has better stuff to be doing (i.e. zapping stuff in the face.)

</em></li>

						<li><strong>Damage Shields (DS):</strong> Mipsy uses the Force to make a shield that 

hurts things that try to attack you melee. Baddies who use magic get through unscathed.<br />
							<em>~This skill is cool, but not worth spending major points on. At the end of the 

game, any spare points you get can go here. Chip damage does add up, after all.</em></li>

						<li><strong>Innate Melee Defense (IMD):</strong> Remember how Mipsy takes hits like a 

wet paper towel? Imagine drying out the towel and making it 5 times as thick. That's what this skill does to Mipsy's defense.<br />

							<em>~Even with plenty of points here, Mipsy isn't a brick wall by any means. This 

skill is awesome, though, because it actually allows Mipsy to take a few hits before dying. Which is always cool.</em></li>

						<li><strong>Innate Casting Haste (ICH):</strong> Mipsy grabs her 4-Hour-Energy and uses 

it to speed herself up. Just as you'd expect.<br />
							<em>~You might be noticing a theme: Haste is awesome. With points here, 

Mipsy gets more chances to spam DD. Fun fun fun.</em></li></ul>

<li><h3 class="biggerheadings">talinia</h3>Talinia's your archer, and she's pretty similar to Rohane in that she can take some damage and deal it 

out too. What sets her apart are her awesome collection of goodies (aka skills), and just for that she's awesome.<br /><br />
					<ul>

						<li><strong>Increased Bow Damage (IBD):</strong> Wonder what this one could do. 

Perhaps it allows Talinia to eat tofu faster. Hmm...<br />
							<em>~Why not invest here? Talinia doesn't hit that hard by default, so pump 

plenty of points in here to make her a macho-Eyrie.</em></li>

						<li><strong>Multiple Targets (MT):</strong> When Talinia feels like it, she can fire a 

bunch of arrows to hit, well, multiple targets. With 1 point invested, she fires 2 arrows; with 6, 3 arrows; and with 11, 4 arrows. The more points you 

spend, the less time it takes between uses.<br />
							<em>~This skill is really cool for softening up the enemy party. It's like GDD but a 

whole lot better, TBH. I like putting 10 points in here: she can fire 3 arrows every 10-15 seconds by Act 5. Meanwhile, at 11 points she fires 4 arrows 

every 20-25 seconds. Why fire 4 arrows once a battle when you can fire 3 arrows twice?</em></li>

						<li><strong>Ranged Attacks (RA):</strong> Tally practices her sniping (and antisocial) 

skills by fighting from farther away than everyone else. If someone tries to hit her (melee or magic), their next turn is set back a bit.<br />
							<em>~Neat skill. Monsters are more likely to hit characters who hit them first. 

Thanks to Talinia's MT, she'll be sticking out like a sore thumb. And thanks to RA, baddies are effectively stunned each time they try to hit Tally. Plus 

it's hilarious seeing a boss stunned for 10 seconds when he uses GDD.</em></li>

						<li><strong>Shockwave (SW):</strong> Not just an Internet plugin. No, this guy works like 

Rohane's SS, except it stuns everything when it works. Keyword: when it works.<br />
							<em>~Looks cool on paper, but RA outclasses it IMO. RA lands a guaranteed stun 

every time, while Shockwave isn't nearly as reliable. Still, if you have spare points at the end you can put 'em here.</em></li>

						<li><strong>Slowing Strike (SS):</strong> Somehow, Talinia manages to slow baddies a 

few percent each time she hits them. Then again, baddies carry gold in their pockets, so anything's possible in NQII.<br />
							<em>~Eh. The effects of this are minimal (only 5% slow at max level) and wear 

off pretty quickly. Put your points elsewhere.</em></li>

						<li><strong>Innate Magic Resistance (IMR):</strong> Talinia doesn't like diabolical Chias 

throwing spells at her, so she's gotten this skill. When you spend points here, she's more resistant to magic. *gasp*<br />
							<em>~Similar to Rohane. Put a few points here in the beginning and some more 

toward the end (if you're wondering, you encounter diabolical Chias in late Act 4.)</em></li>

						<li><strong>Innate Melee Haste (IMH):</strong> Wonder what this one could do. Perhaps 

it allows Talinia to eat tofu faster. Hmm...<br />
							<em>~You can probably guess what I'm going to say here. The more points you 

put here, the more times Tally will be able to hit those diabolical Chias.</em></li></ul>

		<li><h3 class="biggerheadings">velm</h3>Unless you've never looked at this page's header or background (which would be 

pretty hard), you'll know that Velm (the gang's healer) is my favorite NQII character. He's got amnesia and the game's best pickup line: "Don't fidget. 

And get a haircut!<br /><br />
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Healing (Heal):</strong> Remember DD vs. GDD? Well, it's back in the form 

of Heal vs. Group Heal. Scandalicious. Healing, uh, heals any one character for up to 150HP, and it's faster than GH.<br />

							<em>~Unfortunately for the tabloids, there isn't *that* much debate over Heal 

vs. GH. Most people (including me) go with GH, which is more efficient and convenient. You'll see why in a moment.</em></li>

						<li><strong>Group Healing (GH):</strong> Muhahaha. Velm makes healing potions as 

useful as wisdom teeth thanks to this skill. Although it's slower than Healing, GH heals all your guys and gals for up to 90HP.<br />
							<em>~You see why we use GH over Healing? Most of the time all your guys are 

banged up a little. With Healing you'd have to heal them individually. With GH, all you do is click a button and everything's all peachy. NQII'ers are 

lazy so we love this skill.</em></li>

						<li><strong>Group Shielding (GS):</strong> Velm too can use the Force. Unlike Mipsy, he 

makes a shield that makes your team take a little less damage from all attacks.<br />

							<em>~Algebra time (o noez!): GS + GH = most of your defense problems solved. 

You may not notice its effects when you use it, but when baddies start using GS later in the game you'll notice the difference. What more can I say? 

Use it.</em></li>

						<li><strong>Mesmerization (Mes):</strong> Has Velm ever put you in a trance with his 

coolness? Probably not, but he can still put baddies in a trance, preventing them from doing anything. Baddies snap out of it if they're hit or 

healed.<br />
							<em>~Fun skill. Problem is, it gets resisted a lot on harder difficulties and later 

acts. You don't need too many points here for it to work, so spend a few points here (duh) and maybe put some here at the end of the game if you 

have spare points.</em></li>

						<li><strong>Celestial Hammer (CH):</strong> See, Mipsy is horribly scared of cockroaches 

(they're immune to her nukes you see), so she convinced Velm to invest in a hammer. At max level, he can deal 45 damage and a 3-second stun to 

the hapless roaches (and other assorted baddies.)<br />

							<em>~Telling Velm to go on the offensive is like telling Payton Manning to play 

cricket: they're not made for it. Velm has better things to be doing than killing roaches, namely, healing the team. Besides, Velm's melee attack does 

almost as much as this (kinda sad.)</em></li>

						<li><strong>Innate Melee Defense (IMD):</strong> By investing here, Velm ups his 

coolness to such levels that baddies just can't hit him as hard.<br />
							<em>~Dead Velm = Sad you. So yeah, invest here.</em></li>

						<li><strong>Innate Casting Haste (ICH):</strong> Velm grabs some Blue Bull (he prefers 

it over 4-Hour-Energy) and uses it to go faster (duh.)<br />

							<em>~GH and GS both take a while to reload, so Blue Bull is vital for our 

amnesiac friend.</em></li></ul></ul>

		<p>Congrats, you've now leveled up to NQII Wannabe. With this info, you're now ready to tackle the actual game! *blows party

		<p><em>There he is! Get 'im! *tackles you*</em></p>

		<p>*dusts off self* Sorry about that. I get over-eager like that sometimes. At any rate, welcome to the walkthrough part of this 	

			guide. This walkthrough is <strong>divided up by act</strong>, and you can jump between the acts by looking at the, 	

			uh, jump. If you've got eyes, you'll notice that I give recommended levels (and boss HP) for stuff in the format 

<strong>A/B/C, where A 			is for Normal, B for Evil, and C (amazingly) for Insane.</strong>
		<p>Also, you'll notice a table next to the walkthrough area. Before you ask, <span class="quote">Where are the chairs?</span> I'll tell 		

you what it's about. <strong>That table tells you where to spend skill points for each character when you level up.</strong> When you grow to level, 

oh I dunno, 9000, look at the 9000 row. If it says <span class="quote">XD 1</span>, that means you should spend a point in the XD skill so that it reaches level 1. If you 

look at Mipsy in the level 5 column, you'll notice <em>absolutely nothing.</em> *gasp* Well, there will actually be a long box there with some skills 

in there. When you get Mipsy, spend points according to what that long box says. Then continue on your merry way.
			</p>

		<p>If you haven't realized yet, <strong>you'll want to use maps</strong> during the walkthrough. Use any search engine you like 

 and <strong>search for <span class="quote">NeoQuest II Maps</span>.</strong> You might want to bookmark some map sites.</strong></p>
		<p>If you're ever lost or confused, try 2 things: first, try to telepathically communicate with me. Second, visit the <a href="#faq"  class="help">FAQ</a> and see if your answer is there.</p>

		<p>Whoa whoa whoa! Where do you think you're going, eh? First thing you want to do is look up a bit and <strong>read the 

walkthrough intro.</strong> Mm'kay? I'll wait. And while I'm waiting, <strong>now would be a good time to learn how to play the game.

		<div class="flavortext">Good luck! I've packed you a sword and a barrel. What's the barrel for? The monkeys, of course!</div>
		<p>Well, this is where it all begins (and, for plenty of peeps, where it all ends.) Good thing you're not one of those peeps. And 

since you're not one to quit, switch to Hunting mode and head west to exit town. Don't know how to? <a href="#adventuring" class="help">Click here 

to learn how to adventure.</a> Once you encounter a plains lupe, hit <span class="quote">wait 5s</span> until it kills you. Congrats! By letting the lupe kill you, you've 

just 

<strong>earned yourself the Weakling avatar.</strong>

			</p>
		<p>You'll wake up back in Trestin. Leave town by going west, and start snacking on Plains Lupes (if you're hurt, talk to Mother to 

heal.) New to battling? <a href="#battling" class="help">Click here to learn how to battle.</a> Don't go too far until you've gotten to level

		<p>Now you can start fighting in the hills to your north. <strong>Gain a level</strong> here, then head west until all the 

mountains are to your east. Then go north until you hit a forest. Start killing monsters until you're level <strong>4/5/6</strong>, using healing 

potions if needed. No idea how to? <a href="#inventory" class="help">Click here to learn about your inventory.</a>

		<ul>
 
			<li><span class="question">Help! I've gotten lost in a cave and can't get out!</span><br />First off, that isn't a 

question. *glares* Second, here's what you want to do. Pretend you're Rohane. Now walk over to a wall and put your left (or right) hand on it. Start 

walking forward, but do it so that your hand stays on that wall. Eventually, you'll come across a boss or exit.</li>
			<li><span class="question">What's with the <span class="quote">level 10/11/12</span> stuff?</span><br />Thanks for asking a question 

for once. To avoid compromising our information to our enemies, I write in code. 10/11/12 means that you should be level 10 if on Normal, 11 if on 

Evil, and 12 on Insane.</li>
			<li><span class="question">The monsters here are too tough! What can I do?</span><br />Your best bet is to 

backtrack a bit (i.e. exit a cave, leave a desert), which should make the baddies you fight easier.</li>
