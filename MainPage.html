	/*Changelog
		Version - Date - Notes
		1.2 - 11/13- Changed the background a bit, and now this is smallgreenblur's page.
		1.1 - 10/9 - Maybe it's just me, but the whole idea of version numbers is a little stupid. On a side note, I can finally take down 
						that horrendously ugly old page now.
		1.0 - 9/11 - Well, this is the first *official* version of the page.

		<h1 class="heading">uh, hi there</h1> 
		<p>*awkward pause* Uh, hi there #VISITOR. If you were looking for that elusive fountain of youth, you made a wrong turn at Albuquerque. If you were looking for Chias who seek world domination, I think you've found your page (you don't want to know about those Chias...) You're reading the home page of my <strong>NeoQuest II guide</strong>. If you want to play NQII, go ahead and <strong>read this page</strong> first. After that you can start actually playing the game.</p>
		<p>If you're currently following the walkthrough and are completely lost (I don't blame you), scroll all the way up and <strong>click on the act</strong> you want to go to. You can bookmark that page if you like.</p>
		<p>At any rate, have fun.</p>
		</div>
		
<div class="bodycontent" id="qa">
			<h1 class="heading">q & a</h1>
			<p>Hi again. Before we start, I'm going to use my <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">non-existant</span> psychic powers to see what questions you have.</p>
			<ul class="questions">
				<li class="question">So, uh, what is this thing?</li>
				<li class="answer">Good question. This is my NeoQuest II guide.</li>
				<li class="question">NeoQuest II, eh? What's that?</li>
				<li class="answer">NQII's a <strong>role-playing game</strong> released on January 29, 2004 (yes I looked that up.) 					Basically you walk around and beat stuff up until you get to the big ugly dragon at the end of the 					game.</li>
				<li class="question">That's cool, but what's in it for me?</li>
				<li class="answer">Somehow I knew you'd ask that. Well there's a whole section on that but, uh, you'll read 						that later. Anyway, after playing through the game once you get <strong>3 avatars</strong>. And if you beat the 						game on the hardest difficulty you can get a prize that sells for <strong>over 2 million NP</strong>. And stop salivating 					like that, it's scary.</li>
				<li class="question">Mm-hmm. This game must be hard, right?</li>
				<li class="answer">Well, not <em>hard</em>. Just complicated. That's why I wrote this guide.</li>
				<li class="question">That doesn't make sense. There's color... and pictures! And it's not in Times New Roman! 					What sorta NQII guide is this?!?</li>
				<li class="answer">Relax, #VISITOR. NQII guides don't <em>have</em> to be boring, right? I'm allowed to use 					color. It's not like an elite squad of ninjas is gonna fly down from the sky and kidnap me for using color. <span 					style="background-color: white; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; color: black;">Also, this is written in 					Times New Roman. Whatcha gonna do now, eh?</span></li>
			
				<li class="question">You still haven't answered my question about the pictures.</li>
				<li class="answer">That's cause you interrupted me. People learn by pictures, not words. On the Internet, a 					picture is worth 1024 words.</li>
				<li class="question">Uh huh. So when do I get to the walkthrough?</li>
				<li class="answer"> Hold up, cowboy, you gotta <strong>learn the game</strong> before you play it. If you don't, you'll get 					eaten alive by those Chias I was telling you about.</li>
				<li class="question">OK, OK, I get it. But where do I start?</li>
				<li class="answer">Fortunately for you, all you need to do is <strong>read this page</strong>. After that you can start 					playing.</li>
				<li class="question">Believe me, once I'm done with this page I'll control some Chias of my own and set them 					upon you.</li>
				<li class="answer">...</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	<div class="bodycontent" id="interface">
		<h1 class="heading">Game Interface</h1>
			<p>You can't learn anything about NQII unless you know the <strong>basics</strong>. Learning how to fight before learning about the interface is like learning how to ride a horse without knowing what a horse is. (OK, that was a bad comparison, but you get the gist.)</p>
			<p>So when you <strong>start off your NQII game</strong> (you'll want to <a href="http://www.neopets.com/games/nq2/index.phtml">do that so you can follow along</a>), you'll come across a screen like this:</p>
		<div class="center">
		<img src="http://www.fileden.com/files/2010/7/15/2915785/NQIIGuide/IntMain.png" alt="All the stuff. 1 is the top bar, 2 is the right bar, 3 is the actual map.">
		</div>
	<p>Except all the numbers, of course, but that sort of stuff goes without saying. There's loads of information on the screen, so I've <strong>split it up</strong> into 3 pieces. As you read about each button/link/doohickey, <strong>click it in your game</strong> to see for yourself what it does.</p>
</div>	
	<div class="pic" id="interface1">
		<h1>Interface Part 1: The Top Bar</h1>
			<p>Basically, all the <strong>info on your team</strong> goes up here. Really, <strong>don't worry</strong> about <em>Health</em> or <em>Experience</em>. We'll talk more about it later. After you've looked at this picture, take a look at the top bar <strong>in your game</strong>.</p>
		<img src="http://www.fileden.com/files/2010/7/15/2915785/NQIIGuide/Int1.png" alt="You really gotta see this.">
	</div>
	<div class="pic" id="interface2">
		<h1>Interface Part 2: The Right Bar</h1>
			<p>This is probably the <strong>most important</strong> bar. You can do <strong>all sorts of stuff</strong> here, including accessing your items and moving around. Don't feel overwhelmed by the sheer amount of stuff... really, it's not that bad. I think I should clam up now and let the picture do the talking.</p>
			<p>Actually, I have one quick thing to say first. After you look at the picture, <strong>click some of the links</strong> in your game. Try moving around a few steps. See your inventory or talk to mom if you like. Try to get to know the bar. You'll be great friends, trust me.</p>
			<img src="http://www.fileden.com/files/2010/7/15/2915785/NQIIGuide/Int2.png" alt="Again, you really gotta see this.">
		</div>
	<div class="pic" id="interface3">
		<h1>Interface Part 3: The Map</h1>
			<p>The map isn't way too important because you can't really click anything on it. Take a look at the picture to <strong>get familiar</strong> with the map. </p>
			<img src="http://www.fileden.com/files/2010/7/15/2915785/NQIIGuide/Int3.png" alt="Once again, you really gotta see this. Is it RequestPolicy or soething?">
			</div>
	<div class="pic" id="interfacereview">
		<h1>Reviewing the Interface</h1>
		<p>Now that you're an expert on the interface (I hope), it's time to review a bit to test what you've learned. Here are a few things you should do. If you get stuck on anything, <strong>look at the pictures again</strong> and find what made you stuck.</p>
		<table class="todolist">
			<tr class="theadings">
				<td>To practice this...</td>
				<td>Do this.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="task">Getting Around</td>
				<td class="desc">Rohane's landed a job as a pizza delivery boy. A Lupe called Marvis, who lives on the <strong>east side of town</strong>, ordered a grand anchovy pizza with breadsticks. Use the <strong>arrow buttons</strong> to walk over to his house before your 30 minutes are up. <em>Hint: follow the path.</em></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="task">talking to people</td>
				<td class="desc">After an unsuccessful gig as pizza delivery boy, Rohane is now a journalist and need to interview people. Walk around and talk to <strong>everyone in town</strong>. <em>Hint: there are 5 people in town, excluding you.</em></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="task">overall</td>
				<td class="desc">Nothing's going right for Rohane, so he's now a cartographer. Glance at <strong>your game</strong> and look at all the bars/menus/stuff we went over. Try to <strong>explain</strong> what each thing does without looking at the guide.</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
			<p>If you're reading this, I'll assume you got through all that stuff OK. That's good, since we need a good foundation in order to learn the harder things. Which reminds me, we need to start learning harder things. Follow me to the next section...</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="bodycontent" id="items">
		<h1 class="heading">items and your inventory</h1>
			<p>Unless you want to become Chia food, you need to learn how to <strong>use items</strong>. Items are awesome: you can heal yourself, equip yourself with stuff, and... well, that's actually it, but you get the gist of it.</p>
			<table summary="!!NOTE!! Get a better Inventory and Party Info Pic later."></table>
			<div class="center">
			<img src="http://www.fileden.com/files/2010/7/15/2915785/NQIIGuide/InvPartyInfo.PNG" alt="You should see this.">
			</div>
	</div>
	
	<div class="bodycontent" id="shopping">
		<h1 class="heading">shopping</h1>
			<p>Now you know all about items. That's cool and all, but how exactly do you <em>get</em> these so-called <em>item</em> thingies? Well, you <strong>buy them from merchants</strong>. And you can also <strong>sell items</strong> if you want to. Here you'll learn all about shopping.</p>
			<p>In order to shop, you need to walk up to a merchant and select <strong>Trade with [name]</strong>. Walk over to <strong>Pongoras</strong> (he's the Ixi in the green shirt) and ask to trade with him. That'll give you a taste of what the shopping interface looks like.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="pic" id="buying">
		<h1>buying stuff</h1>
			<p>At the top of every "shopping page" there's an option to trade with the merchant. This is how you buy potions and weapons. I think you'll learn more from the picture than from me:</p>
			<img src="http://www.fileden.com/files/2010/7/15/2915785/NQIIGuide/BuyingStuff.PNG" alt="How to buy stuff.">
	</div>
	
	<div class="pic" id="selling">
		<h1>selling stuff</h1>
			<p>Now, buying stuff is easy, since you do it in real life. But when's the last time you sold a sword to a shopkeeper? I thought so. But still, it's easy. <strong>Scroll down from the buying menu</strong> and you'll see the selling menu. And quick clarification: sell all your unequipped weapons, except for the <em>Father's sword</em>. You'll see why at the end of the game.</p>

			<p>OK! You're now an expert with items, and you know how to buy swords and explosive stuff (I really wouldn't trust Rohane with those things, to be honest.) Ready to battle yet?

			<p>Skills are what make the world go round. Well, not really. More accurately, they make <strong>battling a whole lot easier</strong>. Once you know all about skills, you can blast stuff in the face with damage spells, stun stuff with your flashy sword, and more. So what's not to love?</p>
			<p>Before you start, though, there are a few things you need to know.</p>
			<ul id="stufftoknow">
				<li>You gain <em>skill points</em> when you level up.</li>
				<li>You <strong>spend</strong> skill points on these skills.</li>
				<li>You can spend up to <strong>15 skill points</strong> in any skill.</li>
				<li>Skills get <strong>better</strong> as you spend more skill points in them.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Well, now that you've read that, you can <strong>skip the actual skills</strong> if you want. They're good reference for later, though, if you're into that sort of thing.</p>

				<td class="skillname" rowspan="2">Slowing Strikes</td>

				<td class="skillname" rowspan="2">Group Shielding</td>

				<td class="skillname" rowspan="2">Mesmerization</td>
				<td class="info">When Velm casts this on an enemy, the enemy is basically <strong>stunned for a really long time</strong>.

				<td class="skillname" rowspan="2">Celestial Hammer</td>
				<td class="info">Yeah, this is the thing Velm uses to hit Chias. This is basically a spell that both <strong>hurts and stuns</strong> baddies. At its max level, it can deal <em>45 damage</em> and stun for <em>3 seconds</em>.</td>

				<td class="opinion"><b>4</b>. Very fun skill, but it's not all that useful. The damage is hardly anything, and the stun is cool but Mesmerization does it way better. Velm's just not made to go on the offensive.</td>

			<tr>
				<td class="skillname" rowspan="2">Innate Melee Defense</td>
				<td class="info">As you might expect, this skill causes Velm to <strong>take less damage</strong> when baddies attack him.</td>

		<h1>spending skill points</h1>
			<p>Don't get me wrong, learning about skill points is awesome and all, but it isn't going to do you any good unless you <strong>spend them</strong>.

		<p>OK, so I lied again. I'm such a bad guy. But hold up. See, NQII is like a board game... <em>you go, then someone else goes, then someone else goes, and so on</em>. Just one problem: pretend your annoying little cousin is playing with you and he/she sometimes <strong>goes twice in a row</strong> or <strong>skips your turn</strong>. It's almost like all the NQII characters are playing a board game and they're taking turns. While I come to terms with my mythomania, please enjoy this flowchart.</p>

	<div class="pic" id="battle_yourturn">
		<h1>your turn</h1>
		<p>Remember how I told you about <strong>turns</strong>? Well, whenever <strong>someone on your team</strong> gets his/her turn, this is what the screen will look like:</p>

		<p>That screen was just for Rohane's turn, of course. If it was Mipsy's turn, the page would stay more or less the same (however, the <em>Special Abilities</em> section would change a bit.)</p>
		<p>And if you're wondering, there's a maybe 50% chance that you'll flee when you click "flee." If it works, you go back to the overworld but get no experience (even from any baddies you've already killed.) If it doesn't work (the baddies block your path), you're basically stunned for a bit.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="pic" id="battle_theirturn">
		<h1>the baddies' turn</h1>
		<p>(Note how I used the plural. Yeah, you can run into up to 4 baddies at a time, but that's only toward the end of the game.) Anyway, this screen will <strong>look the same</strong> regardless of which baddie is up.</p>

			<p>OK, so you know how to beat stuff up. That's good and all, but knowing how to use a hammer doesn't help you make a sculpture, if you'll excuse that horrible metaphor. Before I send you out into the big scary overworld, you have to know <strong>the best way to battle</strong>.</p>

				<img src="http://www.fileden.com/files/2010/7/15/2915785/NQIIGuide/BattleLogic.png" alt="Kill one baddie at a time.">
			<p>Just beat up one baddie till it's dead, at which point focus on another baddie. Keep beating up baddies until they're all dead. It really doesn't matter what order you kill baddies in. Some people go left to right, some (including me) go highest HP to lowest HP... your call.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="pic" id="battle_end">
